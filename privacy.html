            information when you use our website (https://nearyouapp.xyz) and our visual search services (the
            "Service").</p>

        <p>We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring you have a positive experience on our website. This
            policy specifically addresses our compliance with Google AdSense requirements and other applicable privacy
            laws.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <h3>1.1. Information You Provide Directly</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Images:</strong> When you use our "Scan" feature, you upload an image to our servers for
                analysis. This image is processed in real-time to identify objects and provides search results.
                <strong>We do not permanently store your uploaded images.</strong> They are deleted immediately after
                the analysis is complete.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> We request access to your device's geolocation to provide relevant
                search results "near you". This data is used solely for the purpose of the query and is not stored or
                effectively tracked over time.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>1.2. Automatically Collected Information</h3>
        <ul>

            to measure the effectiveness of their advertising campaigns and/or to personalize the advertising content
            that you see on websites that you visit.</p>
        <p>NearYou has no access to or control over these cookies that are used by third-party advertisers.</p>

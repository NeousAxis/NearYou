        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> December 20, 2025</p>

        <p>Welcome to NearYou! These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the NearYou website located at
            https://nearyouapp.xyz (the "Service") operated by NearYou ("us", "we", or "our").</p>
        <p>By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the
            terms, then you may not access the Service.</p>

        <h2>1. Description of Service</h2>
        <p>NearYou is a visual search tool that allows users to capture images of physical objects to identify them and
            find relevant local and online purchasing options. The Service utilizes artificial intelligence and
            third-party APIs (such as OpenStreetMap and OpenAI) to provide these results.</p>

        <h2>2. Use License</h2>
        <p>Permission is granted to temporarily download one copy of the materials (information or software) on
            NearYou's website for personal, non-commercial transitory viewing only. This is the grant of a license, not
            a transfer of title, and under this license, you may not:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>modify or copy the materials;</li>
            <li>use the materials for any commercial purpose, or for any public display (commercial or non-commercial);
            </li>
            <li>attempt to decompile or reverse engineer any software contained on NearYou's website;</li>
            <li>remove any copyright or other proprietary notations from the materials; or</li>

                damage of items purchased from third-party merchants.</li>
            <li><strong>Transactions:</strong> Any financial transactions, refunds, returns, or disputes between you and
                any third-party merchant. Please contact the seller directly for any issues.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Limitations</h2>
        <p>In no event shall NearYou or its suppliers be liable for any damages (including, without limitation, damages
            for loss of data or profit, or due to business interruption) arising out of the use or inability to use the
            materials on NearYou's website, even if NearYou or a NearYou authorized representative has been notified
            orally or in writing of the possibility of such damage.</p>
